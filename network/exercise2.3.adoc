Running a Job Template

Now that you've sucessfully created your Job Template, you are ready to launch it.
Once you do, you will be redirected to a job screen which is refreshing in realtime
showing you the status of the job.

====
*Step 1:* Select JOB TEMPLATES
[NOTE]
Alternatively, if you haven't navigated away from
the job templates creation page, you can scroll down to see all existing job templates

*Step 2:* Click on the rocketship icon image:at_launch_icon.png[Add,35,25] for the *Apache Basic Job Template* +

*Step 3:* When prompted, enter your desired test message +

---

*Step 4:* Select LAUNCH image:at_survey_launch.png[SurveyL,35,25] +

*Step 5:* Sit back, watch the magic happen +

Once the job is running, on the left, you'll have details in regards to what playbook
it's running, what the status is, i.e. pending, running, or complete.  You'll also notice the prefix_control_subnet, prefix_host_subnet, and ios_version being passed in as 'extra_variables'

To the right, you can view standard output; the same way you could if you were running Ansible Core
from the command line. +
