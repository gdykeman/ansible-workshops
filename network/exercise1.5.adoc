= Exercise 1.5 - Executing your playbook and review

---

****
Congratulations!  You just wrote a playbook that incorporates some key Ansible concepts that you use in
most if not all of your future playbooks.  Before you get too excited though, we should probably make sure
it actually runs.

So, lets do that now.

Section 1 - Running your routing_configs playbook

====
*Step 1:* Make sure you are in the right directory.

----
cd ~/networking-workshop
----

*Step 2:* Run your playbook
----
ansible-playbook router_configs.yml

Section 2: Review

If successful, you should see standard output that looks very similar to the following.  If not, just let us
know.  We'll help get things fixed up.

[NOTE]

*If the output is similar to the above, you have successfully run the playbook.  Woohoo!!!* +

So, let's briefly review what we accomplished:

- We declared variables that lists the name servers we want to apply.
- We then registered the values produced by the ios_facts module to use in the subsequent tasks in our playbook.
- Next we created a block with 2 conditionals {router version & inventory_hostname}
- If the conditionals were met, for rtr1, we applied the static route and name server configuration.
- For rtr2 we enabled GigabitEthernet2 & configured it to receive an IP address from DHCP + the similar configurations that rtr1 received. {Static route & name servers}

Section 3: Test!
====
You should now be able to ping your host that resides in a different VPC!
We've bridged the two VPC's via a GRE tunnel and added static routes to allow routing between the two subnets.
----
ping <IP of host node>
----
[NOTE]
IP of the host node is shown as *private_ip=172.16.x.x* in your inventory file @ ~/networking-workshop/lab_inventory/student(x).net-ws.hosts

```
[ec2-user@ip-172-17-3-27 networking-workshop]$ ping 172.18.4.188
